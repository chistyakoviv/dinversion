# dinversion

Lightweight dependency inversion container for javascript.

## Installation

You can get the latest release and the type definitions using npm:

```
$ npm install dinversion --save
```

## Usage
Simply create a container with definitions. Use closures for lazy creating instances of services:

```js
import Container from 'dinversion';

// create a container with definitions
const container = new Container({
    service: function(container) {
        return new Service(container.get('anotherService'));
    },
    anotherService: function(container) {
        return new AnotherService();
    },
    config: {
        env: 'dev'
    }
});

// register a new service
contrainer.set('yetAnotherService', function(container) {
    return new YetAnotherService();
});

container.has('service'); // true
container.get('anotherService'); // AnotherService
container.get('config')['env']; // 'dev'
```
